            <h1>education</h1>
            <p id="p1"> I started my programming journey at Addis Ababa University, AAIT campus, where I learned Python as my first language during the pre-engineering program. Python introduced me to the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving, allowing me to build a strong foundation for my future studies in software development. Its simplicity and versatility made it an excellent starting point for my learning.</p>
            <p id="p2">In my first semester at the software engineering Department, I expanded my programming skills by learning Java. Java provided me with a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming and introduced me to more complex concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and software design principles. It was an exciting challenge that helped me grow as a developer.</p>
            <p id="p3">Currently, in this semester, I am diving into web development. I am learning how to create dynamic, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This new area of focus is allowing me to combine my programming knowledge with creative problem-solving, and I am eager to develop my skills further in this field</p>

            <h1>experience</h1>
            <p id="p1"> As part of my programming journey, I created simple games like Rock Paper Scissors and Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) using Python. These projects allowed me to apply my understanding of basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input. They were both fun and educational, helping me develop problem-solving skills while reinforcing the logic required for creating interactive programs.</p>
            <p id="p2">In Java, I developed a small dictionary application as part of my studies. This project involved creating a program that allowed users to search for words and view their definitions. It helped me strengthen my skills in object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interface design, while also giving me a practical understanding of how to structure and manage data within a program.</p>
            <p id="p3">More recently, I created a webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of web development, from structuring content with HTML to styling it with CSS and adding interactivity using JavaScript. It was a valuable experience in front-end development, and I am excited to continue learning and improving my web development skills.</p>
