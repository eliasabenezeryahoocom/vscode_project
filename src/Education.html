      <p>I attended Kidane Meheret School during my elementary years, and I loved it so much. The teachers were incredibly caring, always guiding us with patience and kindness. The students were friendly, creating a warm and welcoming environment. The school compound was beautiful, offering plenty of space where we could play multiple sports and enjoy our time together. It was a place full of learning, fun, and great memories.</p>

         <p>I had the privilege of completing my high school education at Saint Joseph, widely regarded as the greatest high school in the history of the country. The school is home to some of the most academically exceptional students, surpassing any other institution in the nation. Its teachers, highly experienced and often contributors to textbook writing, bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the classroom. Saint Joseph also offers ample space for sports, promoting a well-rounded education. The schoolâ€™s rich culture, with traditions like morning prayers and prayers before exams, fostered a supportive and disciplined environment that played a significant role in my personal and academic growth.</p>
